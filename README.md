# Stat Friendly

## What is Stat Friendly and It's Purpose

Stat Friendly is an application that will allow for sorted data to be used for statistical analysis. The user interface will allow those with minimal background in statistics to choose the tools they want and understand the results they receive. Simple questions will be asked about how the user will wish to interpret the data they are providing, allowing for a beginner-friendly experience. The user will have access to complex statistical methods such as

* Simple Averages
* Confidence Intervals
* Hypothesis Testing
* Multivariate Analysis

all behind an inviting interface. This can be used by those wanting to step into statistics, those looking for a less complex interface to do their computations, or even those who don't know the difference between a mean and a median.


## Why I chose to make Stat Friendly

Statistics has been the start of everything for me, it is the reason why I am currently pursuing mathematics and computer science. I found that statistics is actually one of the most fascinating areas of study, but it is often painted as a gray field of interest. I find that perspective the result of a lack of knowledge and/or experience, so that is why I want to create statistics more inviting to those from all backgrounds. Ease of entry for the beginner, while also providing convenience for the more experienced.
